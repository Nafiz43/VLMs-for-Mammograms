## System Requirements


## Installation

1. Install all required packages and dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Ollama:
   - Visit [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

3. Download the Ollama models you intend to use locally.

## Running the Project

1. Run the following command to derive responses from LLMs:
   ```
   python3 run_llm.py --model_name=mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q4_K_M --model_type=mistral --save_qa
   ```

   Command breakdown:
   - `--model_name`: Name of the model to run (e.g., mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q4_K_M)
   - `--reports_to_process=-1`: Number of reports to process. It accepts a valid integer. By default=-1; it will process all the reports. 

   LLM responses will be stored in the `local_chat_history` directory.

   To get voted response from the LLMs:
   Run the following command to derive responses based on majority voting:
   ```
   python3 run_llm.py --model_1=llama3.2:latest --model_2=mistral --model_3=llama3.1:latest --reports_to_process=-1
   ```

   Command breakdown:
   - `--model_1`: Name of the FIRST model to run (e.g., mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q4_K_M)
   - `--model_2`: Name of the SECOND to run (e.g., mistral)
   - `--model_3`: Name of the THIRD to run (e.g., llama3.1:latest)
   - `--reports_to_process=-1`: Number of reports to process. It accepts a valid integer. By default=-1; it will process all the reports. 

   LLM responses will be stored in the `local_chat_history` directory.
   


## Calculating the evaluation metrics
1. Open the run_evaluation_weighted.py file if you want weighted average or open run_evaluation_macro.py if you want macro averaging.

2. Update the name of the following variables:

   `file_containing_ground_truth`= It should contain the path to the ground truth data (i,g: 'data/PCL_p.csv')

3. Run the following command in the shell:
   ```
   python3 run_evaluation_weighted.py --reports_to_process=-1
   ```
   OR,
   ```
   python3 run_evaluation_macro.py --reports_to_process=-1
   ```
   Command breakdown:
   - `--reports_to_process=-1`: Number of reports to process. It accepts a valid integer. By default=-1; it will process all the reports. 


4. Results will be stored in `result.csv` file

## Docker Commands:
1. Building the Docker Image:
   ```
      sudo docker build -t pcl-container .
   ```
   This command builds a docker image in the name of "pcl-container"


2. To get inside of the docker image:
   ```
   sudo docker run -it --rm --gpus=all pcl-container /bin/bash
   ```
      This command access the docker image while enabling the GPU access

3. We have to run the ollama server:
   ```
   ollama serve &
   ```

   ollama server is up; lets now install the LLM model, with which we want to run the experiment:

   I. Let's install llama3.2:latest (change the model as per the need):
   ```
   ollama run llama3.2:latest
   ```
   As ollama server is up and the model is installed, now we can run the commands as we have run earlier (non-dockerized version); we dont need to install anything :)


4. To copy the `results` folder from the docker image:
   
   I. Open another terminal

   II. Check the name of the docker image:
   ```
   sudo docker ps
   ```

   III. Hit the following command:
   ```
   docker cp DOCKER_IMAGE:/app/results /home/nikhan/Data/Case_Log_Data/Procedural-Case-Log
   ```

      here, replace 'DOCKER_IMAGE' by the actual name of the docker image


5. To get out of the docker:
   ```
   exit
   ```
